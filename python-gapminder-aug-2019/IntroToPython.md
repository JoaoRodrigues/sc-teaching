# Intro to Python Programming

__Problem:__ You want to learn Python, but where do you start?

- Python programs are simple text files. You can use any text editor to write Python code: e.g. Notepad, Text Edit, nano, vi.
- Professional software developers use Integrated Development Enviromments (IDEs): e.g. PyCharm, Spyder, etc.
- For scripting, text editors specifically designed for coding, like Sublime Text and Atom, are often enough.

- Alternatively, you can use JupyterLab, which is a web-based development environment designed specifically for interactive coding.

- With JupyterLab, you can create notebooks, which contain a mix of annotations, code, and images. These can be shared, exported as pure Python code or as PDFs. They are an incredible tool for collaboration.

- Which programming language you write in depends on what _kernels_ you have installed. There is a Julia kernel, a Python kernel, and an R kernel, thus the name Jupyter.

- The annotations are written in Markdown, an easy-to-write/easy-to-read plain text format that converts to HTML.

- Importantly, JupyterLab, despite running on the browser, runs _locally_ on your computer. You can use it offline, in airplane mode, etc.

- General Notes:

  - Python scripts are plain text files.

  - Use the Jupyter Notebook for editing and running Python.

  - The Notebook has Command and Edit modes.

  - Use the keyboard and mouse to select and edit cells.

  - The Notebook will turn Markdown into pretty-printed documentation.

  - Markdown does most of what HTML does.

## Exercise

Create a new notebook where we will write today's Python code. Let's have the first cell be 'Markdown' and write the name of the lesson (Programming and Plotting in Python) as the header. Then, let's write the date as a sub-header and add a small blurb describing the overall content of today's lesson.
