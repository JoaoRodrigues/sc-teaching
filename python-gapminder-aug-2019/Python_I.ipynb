    "Knowing how to name your variables is _extremely_ important. After all, code is meant to be read. As such, both your future self and your colleagues will appreciate if you put effort in creating clear and informative variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, naming variables follows two simple rules: (1) variable names cannot start with a digit (e.g. 1variable) and (2) they can only contain letters, digits, and underscores. Besides these two rules, Python does not care what you call your variables. People do, however. There are several conventions to naming variables in the Python community, namely those enshrined in the PEP8, the so-called \"official\" Python Style Guide. Its authors _suggest_ that you use lowercase letters for variable names and underscores to separate words, e.g. `first_name` versus `FirstName`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of these suggestions, the most important is to be _consistent_ and to follow whatever conventions others working with you use already. Again, code is meant to be read. The easier someone reads it, the faster they'll understand it, use it, and change it. Use simple and meaningful names. Abbreviations are also fine, as long as they are obvious to the reader: e.g. `idx` instead of `index`, `res` for `residue`, and `aa` for `aminoacid`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, there are some few words that you cannot use as variable names, because they represent special commands or _statements_ in Python. These include  `if` or `for` or `with`. Trying to assign a variable with one of these names will result in an error:"
